# Cluedo
Cluedo is a popular board game.
The objective of the game is to determine who murdered the game's victim, where and
which weapon was used. Each player attempts to deduce the correct answer by
strategically moving around a game board and collecting clues about the
circumstances of the murder from other players.

The aim of the project is to create the perfect Cluedo player, who extracts all
the possible information from the ongoing game and finding the culprit.

The idea being the user feeds the data of the ongoing conversation going about the 
accusation being made as the game goes through, records whether the accusation is true 
or not and if some card is being shown or not.

Python-wise, this project is a way for me to explore the object-oriented
programming to perform data analysis.

## How to run the code
To run the code you should download the entire content of the repository in a folder. Then you can run the following command from the command line:

python Cluedo.py
or
directly run the Cluedo.py file in VS code or any other IDE.

# Ideas for future improvements
-Implementing ML models so that if the game is stopped in between so we can do a supervised learning to predict the
 the suspect, weapon and the room of murder.
-Deploying this model on a website so that instead of writing everything on a terminal and searching for answers by scrolling everytime, we can have a log-sheet storing all the data/arguments held before.
